    * Write a loop that will execute four times. In this loop:
    * (a) use an input dialog to get the student's name into
    *     a String Variable.
    * (b) Use and input dialog to get the student's score into
    *     a String variable
    * (c) Use the Integer.parseInt method to convert the student's score
    *     from a the String variable into an int variable.
    * (d) Print the name and score.
    * (e) Construct a new Student object from this name and score.
    * (f) Call this updateChamp method on this Student object.
    *
    * After the loop:
    * (a) Print the champion's name, in the format of the same run.
    *     You must use the public class
    *     method that you wrote in the Student class for accessing the
    *     champion's name. You must call this method on the class,
    *     not on an object.
    *
    * (b) Similarly, print the champion's score, in the format
    *     of the sample run.
