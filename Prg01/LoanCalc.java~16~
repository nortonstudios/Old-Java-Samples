/** Cruncher Method
     * <ul>
     * <li> The cruncher method uses the user defined variables.  First, the
     * payment counter, payments, is set to zero.  Then a while loop is
     * established. Each cycle through the loop calculates the monthly interest
     * made by the account, and increments the "payments" counter.  The cruncher
     * calculates by dividing the yearly interest, interest, by 12 to convert it
     * into monthly interest, then divides the interest again by 100 to convert
     * the percent into decimal form.  Cruncher then multiplies the interest by
     * the variably "principal" which is the initial principal on the loop's
     * first pass, or is the last month's principal on all subsequent passes.
     * Cruncher then subtracts the interest generated in that month from the
     * monthly payment "payAmount."  In that way, the interest is accounted for.
     * Cruncher then subtracts the monthly payment, minus interest, from the
     * previous principal, and stores the value as the new principal.
     * </ul>*/

/** Main Method does the following:
    * <ul>
    * <li> Prompts the user for the initial principal, monthly payment, and

    * passes it to the LoanCalc object "loan."

    * it, along with the value in loan.intrest.
    * <li> Calls the cruncher method.

    * the amount of each payment, formatted to two decimal places.
